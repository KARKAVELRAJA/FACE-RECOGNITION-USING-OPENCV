### PYTHON CODE TO RECOGNIZE THE FACE USING OPENCV

-----

### WORKFLOW OF FACE RECOGNITION

- Loading Face Detection Algorithms (Fisherface Recognizer/LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) Face Recognizer)
- Loading Classifier for Face Recognition
- Training Classifier for our Dataset
- Reading Frame from Camera and Pre-processing
- Face Detection by its Algorithm (Fisherface Recognizer/LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) Face Recognizer)
- Predicting face by loading Frame into the Model
- Display the Recognized Class with its Accuracy
